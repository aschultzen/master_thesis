\chapter{Conclusion}
The software that has been developed and is described in this report, demonstrates that it is possible to detect and mitigate a spoofing attack like the ones performed with the Civil GPS spoofer, using a spoof proof atomic clock controller. It also demonstrates the efficiency of network enabling GPS receivers and using a Client/Server architecture to collect data over a network.
