\chapter{Conclusion}
The software that has been developed and is described in this report, demonstrates that it is possible to detect and mitigate a spoofing attack like the ones performed with the Civil GPS spoofer, with a spoof proof atomic clock controller. It also demonstrated the stability and capability of the Sensor Server architecture and implementation.
