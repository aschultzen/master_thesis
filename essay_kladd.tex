\section{Global Positioning System: A short introduction}
In our everyday lives we are surrounded with GPS technology. In fields like emergency response, search and rescue, fleet management and even agriculture, it has become a vital tool of utmost importance to everyday operation. For ordinary people, Satellite navigation in cars are by some, used everyday.   

A common misconception is that the GPS satellites track \textit{you} in order to determine where you are. It actually works the other way around. You are, with your GPS receiver, tracking a set of satellites in order to establish your own position.The method used by your GPS receiver to determine its position is called \textit{trilateration}.Trilateration is used in geometry as a process of determining the location (absolute or relative) of point by measuring distance. It is often confused with triangulation which uses angles, where trilateration does not. At any given time, there are at least 24 GPS satellites orbiting the earth \cite{GPSGOV}. In order for a GPS receiver to determine its position, it will need 4 GPS satellites within line of sight \footnote{The line of sight requirement might seem unreasonable, but by the time the signal has reached earth, is has degraded to a minimum of -160 dBW \cite{NATINT}}.

\subsection{Locking on}
\subsection{Jamming}
\subsection{Spoofing}

By emitting a high-power signal at the GPS frequency, one can interfere with the signals emitted by the GPS satellites, effectively denying GPS receivers use of these signals. These signals are already weak considering their travel from space. Such an "attack", although effective, is pretty naive and easily recognized by the jammed party. After all, if you don't have a signal, you are probably being jammed. A more sophisticated approach is to emit a counterfeit signal in order to manipulate the receivers reported time or even position. IRAN, DRONE SPOOF STORY!.

\section{Notes}
A way of detecting a clumsy attempt at jamming, would be to enter a "jam-mode" as soon as the location changes. The PMUs are not supposed to be moved. Why would they anyway? Moving power-plants? Discuss with Harald.
